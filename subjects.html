The course involved working with assignments in a group. We as a group worked our assignments in Python 3. The most notable work here was to build a deCAPTCHA for a fairly simple CAPTCHA scheme.</p><p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">I completed this course with a Performance Index of 8 out of 10.</p></div>

                    <div style="background-color: red; color:white;" class="target"><p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">In this course, I learnt about efficient communication algorithms that sustain a large parallel network. The most notable work in this course was to write a parallel code to identify the  number of clusters in a huge real life data set of N body simulation. I also studied the high level architecture of the IBM BlueGene and IIT Kanpurs HPC2013 supercomputer. The course involved assignments that had to be done individually. Assignments had to be done in C language with extensive support from the MPICH library.</p><p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">I completed this course with a Performance Index of 8 out of 10.</p></div>

I surfaced web-security, network security as well. I also learnt about privilage escalations, and how we can minimize its effects by running code in isolation. This course involved a CTF challenge, where in we had to analyse the binary of a file, and break it to read secret hashes stored in a protected file. The most notable work in this course was to design a DropBox like application to store files securely, which was written in Golang.<br><br> I completed the course with a performance index of 10 out of 10.</p></div>

                    <div style="background-color: blue;color:white;" class="target"><p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">In this course, our objective was to build a good foundation of different types of logics. Based on that foundation, we were supposed analyse systems for the security they offer. This course was mostly concerned with SAT/SMT solvers in Scala. Major work in this course involves verifying if a firewall satisfies the required security specifications. <br><br>I completed this course with a performance index of 10 out of 10.</p></div>

                        <p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">This course equipped me with the basic maths that was required to understand the current cryptographic standards. I understood how various symmetric encryptions such as AES and DES work. I also dived into public key cryptography. I also got a superficial grasp on elliptic curve cryptography. The assignment in this course was a text adventure game which involved breaking various ciphers to clear a particular level. Over the course of the semester, we broke:</p>

                            <li>RSA (with low public exponent, using coppersmiths LLL based attack)</li>

                     <div style="background-color: red;color:white;" class="target"><p style="margin:20px; font-family: Courier;">In this course, we focused on malwares that are common in Windows environment. We got comfortable with a lot of tools such as Strings, PEiD, PEview, Dependency Walker, File Analyzer, etc. We learnt about the behaviors of various kinds of malwares. The most notable work in this course was to design a Machine Learning model trained on a huge set of known malwares and benignwares, to detect malwares.<br><br> I completed this course with a performance index of 10 out of 10.</p></div>
